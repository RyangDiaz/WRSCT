Weather Radar Storm Cell Tracking

The intention of this program is to track the movements of visible storm cells and calculate their velocities based on a sample of radar images in the past hour. Radar images are found from the WeatherUnderground Intellicast radar loop (at https://www.wunderground.com/maps/radar/current).
